# Real-Time Data Streaming with AWS Kinesis

This project demonstrates a Java-based solution for real-time data streaming using AWS Kinesis. The application fetches data from an external API (e.g., cryptocurrency prices) and streams it to a Kinesis Data Stream for further processing.

## Features
- Fetches live data from an external API.
- Streams data to AWS Kinesis in real-time.
- Modular design with Java and Maven.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with Kinesis Data Stream configured.
- Java JDK 11 or higher.
- Maven for build management.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-data-streaming.git
   cd real-time-data-streaming
